**DESCRIPTION:**

This script is like a smart assistant that helps predict the prices of houses in California. It looks at different things about houses (like their size, location, etc.), learns from them, and then tries to guess how much a new house might be worth. It even tries out a few different "guessing methods" to find the best one!

**Features**:

Gets House Data: Automatically fetches real California housing information.
Looks at the Data (EDA): Checks for missing information, shows how house prices are spread out, and finds out which factors are most connected to house prices (like whether more rooms mean higher prices).
Gets Data Ready: Organizes the house information, splits it into parts for learning and testing, and makes sure all numbers are on a similar scale so the computer can understand them better.
Picks Important Factors: Identifies the most important details about a house that help in predicting its price.
Trains Different Predictors: Uses several "guessing methods" (like simple math, a "forest" of decisions, or a "boosting" method) to learn from the data.
Checks How Good the Guesses Are: Measures how accurate each guessing method is at predicting prices.
Fine-Tunes the Best Predictor: Takes the best guessing method and adjusts its settings to make it even more accurate.
Shows Results: Displays how well the best method predicted prices, including a graph to compare the actual prices with the predicted ones.
